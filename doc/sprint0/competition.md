## Existing Products

1. **Quizlet**  
   [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com) is a well-known study app that allows users to create, share, and study flashcards across various subjects. It offers features like games, practice tests, and the ability to import notes, but it primarily focuses on flashcard-style learning.

2. **Kahoot!**  
   [Kahoot!](https://kahoot.com) is an interactive quiz platform that emphasizes learning through competition in classrooms. Itâ€™s popular for classrooms and events, focusing more on live quizzes rather than self-paced study.

3. **Anki**  
   [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) is a flashcard program that utilizes spaced repetition to enhance memorization. While powerful for individual learning, its interface can be complex, and it lacks social features for collaboration.

### Why Competitors May Not Focus on These Users

1. **Niche Focus**  
   Many existing products, like Quizlet and Anki, focus on flashcard-style learning and may not see the demand for more dynamic, AI-driven features.

2. **Resource Allocation**  
   Competitors might prioritize scalability and user retention over advanced features that require additional development.

3. **Target Audience**  
   Other apps often focus on educational institutions or traditional study methods, overlooking the need for diverse learning techniques for those who seek flexibility and engagement.
