# Team Collaboration Summary

## Team Organization and Tools

Our team primarily communciates and collaborates over Discord, enabling us to connect more conveniently through
regular voice calls. Discussing the project's direction, sharing ideas, and clarifying questions, the platform allows us to communicate freely
and adjust plans as we need. 

All work is managed through a Github repository for version control and accessibility to other group members, while task planning and 
sprint tracking is done over Trello.

## Decision Making

Our approach to making decisions as a collective follows a more flexible method, where communication is primarily encouraged. Our meetings,
whether in person or virtual, entails the opportunity to openly discuss and share ideas as we work through questions or concerns together. While
our team is comfortable with accepting and communicating ideas, conversations regarding topics requiring more thought are kept open, allowing
us to revisit it in the next call. This approach offers us the flexibility to critically think through each aspect without feeling rushed, while
also keeping in mind important due dates and encouraging everyone to participate in the decision-making processes.

## Meeting Frequency

Mandatory meetings held over Discord are conducted every week, allowing each team member to provide updates regarding each member's progress
and any encountered issues. This way our team remains aligned through every deliverable, offering the appropriate time to ensure the project
is frequently reviewed with further supplementary meetings held whenever the team feels it is necessary. 

While our meetings don't follow any concrete format, tasks, progress, and troubleshooting are topics discussed during these sessions, as 
this setup provides the team with the ability to adapt to project needs and to each other's schedules.

# Key Takeaways and Improvements

## Communication
One of the most important takeaways from this sprint is the need for an open and continuous line of communication. Using discord to keep all discussions in 
one place, we've created a comfortable space where each person's insights are valued. The flexibility in our communication allows us to 
respond quickly to issues and brainstorm solutions effectively without having to call for a meeting every time. Treating every aspect
as a team-oriented motive, our less rigid approach has strengthened our sense of collaboration and cohesion as a team.

## Organic Decision Making
Another takeaway that we value is our free-form approach to making decisions. We've come to find that our decisions come more naturally when 
everyone contributes at their own pace. As opposed to following a strict process or voting system, we hold discussions where ideas are topics
are elaborated on in detail. This way, each perspective is considered, and we find that we're able to naturally arrive at a consensus. 

## Structured Meetings
While our approach has greatly benefitted our team’s creativity and morale, we’ve also recognized the importance of setting clearer goals at the 
start of each meeting. Having a rough agenda helps streamline our discussions to improve productivity, as all points that need to be addressed
are covered effectively. Without any sort of guideline for our meetings, at times we find conversations feeling a little less put together
leading to calls that are longer than necessary. As an improvement for the next phase, we aim to introduce brief agendas before each call, or
at least address key points to be covered in upcoming meetings.
