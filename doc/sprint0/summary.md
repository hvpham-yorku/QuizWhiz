# Project Objective
Build a quiz application that allows users to create custom questions and quizzes. The application enables the user to create questions, and from these questions, the user can compile a custom quiz.

## **Key Persona**

- **Jimmy** - A senior high school student who is currently taking school courses to apply for York University. Jimmy prefers to study using flashcards and quizzing himself with his own notes.

- **William** - An elementary school teacher currently teaching grade 2. Williamâ€™s class is learning the multiplication table, and he would like to provide additional practice resources for his students.

## **Key Scenarios**

- **Scenario 1** - Jimmy has a math test coming up next week that he needs a good mark on. He plans to study every day prior to the test.
  
- **Scenario 2** - William wants to make sure all his students are strongly familiar with their multiplication table. To do this, he plans to provide extra practice for his students.

## **Key Principles**

- **Simplicity and Efficiency** - The design should allow users to create and upload questions and build quizzes from these questions without too many steps. Features should only be a few clicks away.
  
- **Clean and Minimal UI** - The UI design should be very minimal to prevent distractions and allow students to focus fully on their studies.
